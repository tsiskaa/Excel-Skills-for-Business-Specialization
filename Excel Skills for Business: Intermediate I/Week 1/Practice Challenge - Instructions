In this practice challenge, you are going to apply what you have learned this week in a new context.

STEP 1: Download the workbook below and open it in Excel.
(W1_PracticeChallenge_Bondi)

STEP 2: To make the workbook easier to use you should give each sheet a meaningful name. Change the sheet names as follows:

Sheet1: Q1

Sheet2: Q2

Sheet3: Q3

Sheet4: Q4

STEP 3: Make a copy of Q1, move it to the left of Q1 (after Inventory), and rename it to Sales Summary. Change the heading to Sales by Category – Bondi and delete the unit sales and revenue figures, but not the categories or total calculations.

STEP 4: It is useful to provide visual clues to users. Change the tab colours of the Quarterly Sales sheets to red and the Summary data to blue.

STEP 5: Since the worksheets are set up identically, they are perfectly suited for 3-D cell references. Use 3-D cell references to sum up the books sold and revenue by category for Q1, Q2, Q3 and Q4 in the Summary sheet. Save your workbook.

STEP 6: Download and open the workbooks below, and arrange them so you can see all four on the screen.
W1_PracticeChallenge_Avalon
W1_PracticeChallenge_HeadOffice
W1_PracticeChallenge_Manly

STEP 7: In W1_PracticeChallenge_HeadOffice.xlsx go to the HO Sales Summary tab. Use linking formulas to total the books sold and revenue (by category) for the three branches (Manly, Bondi & Avalon).

STEP 8: Still in W1_PracticeChallenge_HeadOffice.xlsx go to the HO Inventory tab. Because the inventories are slightly different for each store we can’t use linking formulas to get a total inventory. Instead, use the Consolidate tool (no links) to find out the total number of books we have in stock for each title.
